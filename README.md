# Step-Controlled-LED-Brightness-System
This project demonstrates a PWM-based LED brightness control system using Arduino. Two push buttons (red &amp; yellow) are used to increase or decrease brightness step by step, and a buzzer provides alerts when the maximum or minimum limit is reached.

 Components Used
Arduino Uno
1 × LED (connected to PWM pin)
1 × Red Push Button (increase brightness)
1 × Yellow Push Button (decrease brightness)
1 × Buzzer (limit alerts)
Resistors, Breadboard, Jumper Wires

Features
Stepwise LED brightness increase with red button
Stepwise LED brightness decrease with yellow button
Buzzer alerts when brightness reaches maximum or minimum
Serial Monitor displays warning messages
